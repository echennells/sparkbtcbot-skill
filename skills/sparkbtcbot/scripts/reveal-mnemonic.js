// Show the wallet's 12-word mnemonic ON DEMAND, decrypted from seed.enc, so the
// user can back it up offline — WITHOUT ever writing a persistent plaintext file
// (the old MNEMONIC_BACKUP_*.txt undercut encryption-at-rest until it was rm'd).
//
// This prints a seed phrase. Protections, and their HONEST limits:
//   1. It refuses unless BOTH stdout AND stdin are real TTYs. An agent running
//      this over a plain Bash tool has piped stdio (isTTY=false) — it aborts and
//      prints nothing. Requiring stdin-TTY also stops a piped `y\n` from
//      auto-answering the confirm below.
//   2. It requires an interactive y/N confirmation before printing.
//
// LIMIT (do not oversell this): the TTY check is a backstop against the ACCIDENTAL
// capture — an agent that helpfully runs the command with piped output. It is NOT
// a defense against a determined agent that allocates a full pseudo-terminal
// (under a PTY, isTTY is true and the PTY output is exactly what gets captured).
// Nothing can make "print a secret to a terminal the caller controls" safe. The
// real protection is the behavioral rule "the agent must not run this — the user
// runs it themselves", plus: this adds no attack surface a compromised process
// lacked, since anything with the passphrase + seed file can call loadMnemonic
// directly. So: backstop against a mistake, not a security boundary.
