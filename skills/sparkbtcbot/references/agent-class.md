# Complete SparkAgent Class

Load when building an agent that wraps `SparkWallet` with a higher-level API for identity, balance, transfers, Lightning, Spark invoices, tokens, withdrawal, message signing, L402 paywalls, and event listeners. Drop-in implementation.

## Methods at a glance

The `SparkAgent` class exposes these (all `async` unless noted); full signatures and bodies are in the code below.

- **Identity & balance** — `getIdentity()`, `getBalance()` (returns normalized `{ sats, tokens }` — the raw `wallet.getBalance()` returns `{ satsBalance, tokenBalances }`; same name, different shape, not interchangeable)
- **Deposits** — `getDepositAddress()`, `getSingleUseDepositAddress()`, `listPendingDeposits()`, `claimDeposit(...)`
- **Send** — `transfer(...)`, `transferTokens(...)`, `batchTransferTokens(transfers)`, `withdraw(...)` (L1 cooperative exit), `getWithdrawalFeeQuote(amountSats, address)`, `getTransfers(limit, offset)`
- **Lightning** — `createLightningInvoice(amountSats, memo, options)`, `payLightningInvoice(bolt11, ...)` (persists one dedup `transferId` per invoice, so a warranted retry of the same invoice cannot double-pay — `references/lightning.md` → Retry Dedup), `estimateLightningFee(bolt11, amountSats)`, `getLightningSendRequest(id)` (poll an initiated send for its preimage), `payAndSettle(bolt11, ...)` (pay + wait for the preimage, VERIFIED against the invoice's payment hash; check status before any retry on its timeout). ⚠️ `payLightningInvoice` here takes a **bare BOLT11 string** first; the raw `wallet.payLightningInvoice` takes **one `{ invoice, ... }` object** — not interchangeable, and the raw layer crashes opaquely on a bare string (`references/lightning.md` → Pay)
- **Spark invoices** — `createSatsInvoice(amountSats, memo)`, `createTokenInvoice(tokenIdentifier, amount, memo)`, `fulfillInvoice(invoices, options)` (allowlist-gated on each invoice's decoded receiver; supports `dryRun`)
- **L402 paywalls** — `fetchL402(url, options)`, `previewL402(url)`
- **Message signing** — `signMessage(text)`, `verifyOwnSignature(text, signature)`
- **Events & lifecycle** — `onTransferReceived(cb)` (sync), `onDepositConfirmed(cb)` (sync), `vaultHealth()` (sync), `spendStatus()` (rolling-window budget state, `{ disabled: true }` when `SPARK_DAILY_BUDGET_SATS` is unset), `await cleanup()`
- **Static factory** — `SparkAgent.create(mnemonic, network)` → `{ agent, mnemonic }`; throws on a missing mnemonic instead of silently generating a fresh wallet (deliberate creation is `npm run setup`)

## Usage

```javascript
import { loadMnemonicFromEnv } from "./lib/encrypted-seed.js";

const mnemonic = await loadMnemonicFromEnv(); // reads SPARK_PASSPHRASE
const { agent } = await SparkAgent.create(mnemonic);

const identity = await agent.getIdentity();
console.log("Address:", identity.address);

const { sats } = await agent.getBalance();
console.log("Balance:", sats, "sats");

await agent.cleanup(); // flushes a final recovery-bundle snapshot if needed
```
