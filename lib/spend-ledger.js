// Cumulative outbound-spend ledger — the enforcement behind "a stated budget".
//
// Every other guard in this library is PER-CALL: a fee cap, an amount ceiling,
// a quote match. None of them can stop a LOOP — an agent that pays 100
// invoices, each individually under its cap, drains a wallet while every
// single check passes. This ledger closes that class: sat spends are recorded
// to disk and a rolling-window budget (default 24h) is checked against the
// running total BEFORE each new spend.
//
// Threat model, stated honestly (same as the recipients allowlist): this is a
// guardrail against the agent surprising the operator — a runaway loop, a
// prompt-injected shopping spree — NOT a defense against a compromised
// process, which can call the SDK directly or delete the ledger file. No
// control shipped here survives process compromise; the funded balance is
// the only cap that does — size it as a loss you can absorb.
//
// Failure posture:
//   - An UNREADABLE ledger file fails CLOSED (throws) — a corrupt file must
//     not silently mean "fresh ledger, spend away". Reset by deleting it.
//   - An unreadable spend amount fails CLOSED when a budget is set.
//   - Recording uses the shared atomic writer, so a crash never publishes a
//     truncated ledger. Entries are pruned once they age out of the window.
//   - Single-agent-per-ledger assumption: two PROCESSES writing the same path
//     can lose each other's appends (last-writer-wins). Give concurrent
//     agents separate ledger files and budgets. NOTE: in-PROCESS concurrency
//     (e.g. Promise.all of many sends on one SparkAgent) is a real race too —
//     assertCanSpend + record must run as one critical section or parallel
//     sends all pass the same pre-burst check and clobber each other's
//     append. The SparkAgent wrapper serializes this (see #recordSpend); a
//     direct user of createSpendLedger must serialize check-then-record too.
