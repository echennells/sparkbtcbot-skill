// Persistent Lightning payment-dedup identities (spark-sdk ≥0.10 `transferId`).
//
// The SDK dedupes a Lightning payment on `transferId` across every rail it can
// settle on — Spark fallback transfer, preimage swap, SSP admission — so a
// retry that REUSES the first attempt's ID cannot produce a second payment.
// That guarantee is only as durable as the ID: minted fresh per call (the
// SDK's default when the caller omits it), a crash between "request sent" and
// "outcome known" leaves no safe retry. This store makes the ID survive the
// crash: one file per invoice, WRITTEN BEFORE the first pay attempt, keyed by
// the invoice's payment hash, so any later attempt at the same invoice — same
// process, next process, or a concurrent one — resolves to the same ID.
//
// Concurrency is settled by the kernel, not by locks: entries publish through
// atomic-file's exclusive link(2) mode (create-or-EEXIST, never replace), so
// two racers cannot both mint — the loser reads the winner's file. This holds
// across processes, not just within one.
//
// Fail-closed doctrine: an UNREADABLE entry throws instead of minting a fresh
// ID, because a fresh ID for an invoice that may already have a payment in
// flight is exactly the double-pay this store exists to prevent. The
// deliberate reset is deleting the entry file, and the error says what that
// forfeits. Pruning honors the same rule: only entries whose recorded expiry
// has passed are removed; unreadable ones are left for a human.
//
// This module stays SDK-free (the mint function is injected) so the library
// keeps working — and testing — without @buildonspark/spark-sdk installed.
