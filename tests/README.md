# Test suite

Three tiers, run via `npm` scripts.

| Script | Tier | Network | Funding | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `npm test` | unit | none | no | Default. SDK exports, balance shape regression. ~500ms. |
| `npm run test:integration` | read-only | REGTEST | no | Wallet init, addresses, invoices, message signing against Spark's hosted REGTEST. ~10s. |
| `npm run test:funded` | funded | REGTEST | **yes** | Transfers, Lightning payments. Skipped unless `SPARK_TEST_MNEMONIC` is set. |
| `npm run test:all` | all | REGTEST | optional | Runs everything; funded tier auto-skips without env var. |

    deposit.test.js                 # static & single-use deposit addresses
    invoice.test.js                 # createSatsInvoice, createLightningInvoice
    message-signing.test.js         # sign/validate against own identity key

```

The layout mirrors `@buildonspark/spark-sdk/src/tests/integration/` (one file per capability). The SDK targets `Network.LOCAL` because it owns its operator stack; we target `REGTEST` because that is the only hosted network besides MAINNET.

## Why a manually-funded wallet

The Lightspark regtest faucet (https://app.lightspark.com/regtest-faucet) is a UI form, not a documented HTTP API. Hammering an undocumented endpoint from CI is fragile — it can change or rate-limit without warning, and faucets are a free shared resource for the dev community. The right pattern, here as for any testnet faucet, is **fund once, reuse the wallet**.

## Enabling the funded tier

One-time setup:

1. Generate a fresh REGTEST wallet and capture its Spark address:
   ```bash
   SPARK_NETWORK=REGTEST npm run example:setup
   ```
   This prints a 12- or 24-word mnemonic and a `sparkrt1p...` Spark address.

2. Get an L1 deposit address from that wallet:
   ```bash
   SPARK_NETWORK=REGTEST SPARK_MNEMONIC="<mnemonic>" npm run example:balance
   ```
   The output includes a static deposit address (looks like `bcrt1...` or similar).

3. Open https://app.lightspark.com/regtest-faucet, paste the L1 deposit address, and submit. Wait for ~3 confirmations.

4. Claim the deposit (the SDK or the example flow turns L1 sats into Spark balance).

5. Save the mnemonic to `.env`:
   ```bash
   SPARK_TEST_MNEMONIC="<your 12 or 24 word mnemonic>"
   ```

6. Run the funded tier:
   ```bash
   npm run test:funded
   ```

The same wallet funds thousands of test runs — top up only when balance gets low.

## CI guidance

- Default CI workflow: `npm test` then `npm run test:integration`. Both run without secrets and exercise the API surface.
- Optional nightly job: store `SPARK_TEST_MNEMONIC` as a repo secret, run `npm run test:funded`. A small balance lasts a long time at 100 sats per transfer test.
- Without the secret, the funded tier auto-skips (`it.skip`) — the suite does not fail.

## Adding a new test

- Pure logic, no network → `tests/unit/`.
- Hits Spark, no funds needed (read addresses, create invoices, sign messages) → `tests/integration/`.
- Moves sats or pays invoices → `tests/integration/funded/` and gate it with `itFunded` from the helper.

When adding a funded test, prefer small amounts (≤1000 sats) and make idempotent assertions where possible — wallets persist across runs.
