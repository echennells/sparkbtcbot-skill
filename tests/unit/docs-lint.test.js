// Docs lint: the install story is "one runtime" — sparkbtcbot-skill installed
// into the user's project, CLIs resolved LOCALLY. The banned pattern below
// (`npx -y --package=...`) was the old workaround: an unpinned registry fetch at
// wallet-bootstrap time that bypassed the user's lockfile and hardening policy.
// It was scrubbed from every doc on 2026-08-06; this lint keeps it from creeping
// back through copy-paste. Also pins the README Node badge to package.json's
// engines floor — they drifted once (badge said >=18 after engines moved to >=20).
